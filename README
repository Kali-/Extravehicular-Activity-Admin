Extravahicular-Activity-Admin is a set of GPL tools ment to make administrating Spacewalk and RHN Sattellite easier.
Most of these scripts ar written in Perl as that is the language that the language their developers know best.

  The primary goal of this project is to write new tools that will get either integrated into the main spacewalk code 
base or inspire the development of other tools possibly written in python as that seems to be the current most popular 
language for the tools currently being developed in the spacewalk source repositories. These tools should serve to 
supplement the existing tools functionallity

  The secondary Goal of this project is to identify inefficiencies in the current tools and come up with methodoligies
to correct those inefficiencies. The new methodoligies should where ever possible utilize the existing Spacewalk, 
RedHat Satellite, and RHN API's. That being said once more efficient methodoligies are found tested and proven to work
they should have corrosponding RFE's created or at the very least discussions on the development mailing list for 
Spacewalk, with the intent of where possible improving the existing tool or only where more practicle replacing it
with the new tool this project has devised.

  The third goal is to identify shortcommings in the current API's. While the developers for Spacewalk and Redhat 
Satellite do a fantastic job no one group of developers can think of every thing. This is not a critisizim its just 
a fact of development which is why GPL projects produce the great code they do. That being said its best to give the 
core developers and the comunity developers who contribute in their spare time exact, through, consise, and acurete
specifications when requesting new features. Its also best to include consise use cases as well so their development can
be prioritized appropriately.
